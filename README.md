# Multilocation-Transshipment-Optimization

## Abstract
This project is aimed at comparing the performance of different models while solving the
multi-location transshipment problems. This kind of problem is designed to minimize the
collective long-run average costs for multiple retailers supported by one supplier. In
order to do the comparison, we applied both SD solver and SQG method to the original
model as well as the updated model. The difference between the two models is that we
encourage retailers to transship between each other to meet the demands and the
transshipment cost between retailers is calculated based on distances in the updated
one. After comparison, we found the SD solver takes significantly less time to get
almost the same result as the SQG method.
